  This work considers the capitalization of urban hazard information via the residential real estate marketof Lisbon, Portugal. We employ a spatial hedonic framework to estimate  the impact of being located across areas in the municipality with a heterogeneity of urban flooding risks or seismic hazards. Special attention is given to the modifiable  aerial unit  problem  and  spatial  influences  in  constructing   measures  or  incorporating  spatial considerations to the empirical estimation. We construct gridded spatial fixed effects which mitigate these biases and  further  employ  a  geographic  regression  discontinuity  ensuring our resultsare  not  sensitive  to  underlying locational features. 
  
  Results indicate that the residential real estate market responds to hazard information with lower dwelling pricesobserved in areas with a high risk in the range of 2.3% for flooding risk and 1.1% for seismic risk. The largest responseoccurs due to urban flooding which is highly publicized and a relatively common occurrence for residents in comparison to seismic activity.Results suggest further that the combined effect of being subject to multiple  hazards yield larger price  reductionsin the  order of 2.8%, highlighting  the  importance of considering local contexts and interactive  behaviour for policy discussion and mitigation planning.Flooding risk zones are heterogeneous in their impacts with ecological amenities such as parks or urban forests mitigating this negative impact while higher density areas compound the negative effect.
