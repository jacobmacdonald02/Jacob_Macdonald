Born in St. John's, Newfoundland (Canada), I completed my bachelors degree in Economics and Statistics at [Memorial University of Newfoundland & Labrador](https://www.mun.ca/). I then moved to Lisbon, Portugal, to pursue a Masters and PhD in Economics and Finance at the [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/en/).

In my current role I am a Research Fellow Data Scientist at the Consumer Data Research Lab within the University of Liverpool's [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/).

My research focuses on spatial statistics and in particular the valuation of urban-environmental local amenities and spatial, temporal processes in real estate and environmental data. I'm a broad champion of leveraging novel data sources, and in particular working with open data/ software, and open science.
