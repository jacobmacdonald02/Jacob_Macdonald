Born in St. John's, Newfoundland (Canada), I completed my bachelors degree in Economics and Statistics at [Memorial University of Newfoundland & Labrador](https://www.mun.ca/). I then moved to Lisbon, Portugal, for a Masters of Research and PhD in Economics and Finance at the [Nova School of Business and Economics](https://www2.novasbe.unl.pt/en/).

I am currently a Lecturer in GIS and Spatial Analysis with the University of Sheffield - [Department of Urban Studies and Planning](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/usp), and was previously a Geographic Data Science Research Fellow with the [Consumer Data Research Lab](https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/) within the University of Liverpool's [Geographic Data Science Lab](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geographic-data-science/).

My research focuses on urban data, spatial statistics and in particular leveraging big, novel data sources for studies of urban environmental and economic processes. I'm interested especially in the interplay and spill-overs of urban amenities, the built environment and neighbourhood dynamics. I'm a broad champion of open data/ software, open science, and secondary data sources.
